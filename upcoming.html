            <h4>Drag and Drop Interface</h4>

            <p>We want you to have a comfortable editing experience. To achieve this, Karybu has some useful tools: two WYSIWYG editors and “Drag and drop” widgets.</p>

            <h4>Symfony2 Backbone</h4>

            <p>By using Symfony2 components we have become interoperable with other applications that use them.</p>

            <h4>Modular / Extensible</h4>

            <p>All projects are unique and most are very different from one another. We built Karybu so that you can configure this CMS exactly how you need it. Add the modules that suit your project to the core.</p>

            <h4>Twitter Bootstrap on Top</h4>

            <p>All front-end developers want to speak the same language, so we implemented Twitter Bootstrap that is packed with features and responsive by nature.</p>

            <h4>Powerful Admin Interface</h4>

            <p>Karybu has a highly intuitive and easy to use web-based interface that is also feature rich. <!-- TO DO link to demo to go here--></p>

            <h4>Opensource</h4>

            <p>You can download it, use it as you want and, why not, improve it. Karybu is an open source solution that is freely available to everyone.</p>
