<p>This is a plug and play theme designed to fit the needs of any type of user. It comes with enhanced functionality and extensions so that you can restyle your website in a matter of minutes. As an addition we added cool tips on the homepage, so that you understand what its all about before you even get to the backend. We don't want our users to think about how things work, instead we would like to see that users find our interface intuitive and easy to use. </p>

<p>Widget boxes - we decided to break the website into boxes so that it's easier to manage and edit each area individually. Our primary boxes are the header, the content and the footer, but you can add as many boxes&nbsp; as you want.</p>
<p>Widgets - each box can be split in multiple columns,&nbsp; allowing you to easily create a custom structure with the expense of a few clicks.</p>
<p>Extensions - the extensions are actually plug-ins that let you extend the default functionality.</p>
<p>Edit mode - once you login as admin you can see the handlers that let you edit each zone and widget individually.</p>

<p>The first thing that grabs attention when you see the homepage is the slider. The slider is actually one of our widgets, and you can easily modify it by clicking on the edit icon, or you can simply delete it by pressing the trashcan icon. Each of the widgets have their own options depending on the features they present and context.</p>

<p>When you hover over a widget you will see the handlers that let you modify the size of your widget.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="page-header"><h2><small>Visibility</small></h2></div>
<p>You can choose on which pages to showcase a custom box by playing around with visibility options.</p>
