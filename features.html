            <h4>Symfony2 components</h4>
            Symfony allows you to use certain of its software building blocks (dependency injector, http abstraction, event dispatcher) without necessarily using the framework in its entirety. Which is what we did in order to provide developers with the best tools for creating lovely modules.

            <h4>WYSIWYG editors</h4>
            To have a great experience in content management for your website the editor component has to be simple, intuitive but also feature rich. So we used <br> CKEditor (default) and TinyMCE, two of the best editors out there.

            <h4>Use inspiration from other websites</h4>
            There are a lot of interesting things on the web that serve as inspiration. But when we actually want to publish something, most of us forget not only the URL that was inspiring but also the fact of having found something inspiring in the first place. In this regard you can try our Material (Ingredients Collector) module. All you have to do is drag ingredients / materials such as texts, links, images or videos that you have collected before when publishing something with our editors.
