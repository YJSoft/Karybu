<p>Description</p>
<p>Freshstart is a plug and play theme designed to fit the needs of any type of user. It comes with enhanced functionality and extensions so that you can restyle your website in a matter of minutes. As an addition we added cool tips on the homepage, so that you understand what its all about before you even get to the backend. We don't want our users to think about how things work, instead we would like to see that users find our interface intuive and easy to use. </p>

<p>Taxonomy</p>
<p>Zones - we decided to break the website into zones so that it's easier to manage and edit each area individually. Our primary zones are the header, the content and the footer, but you can add as many zones&nbsp; as you want.</p>
<p>Widgets - each zone can be split in multiple columns,&nbsp; allowing you to easily create a custom structure with the expense of a few clicks.</p>
<p>Extentions - the extensions are actually plug-ins that let you extend the default functionality.</p>
<p>Posts - posts help us keep everything organized, so that you can easily create a blog/carrousel/slider/etc. </p>
<p>Edit mode - once you login as admin you can see the handlers that let you edit each zone and widget individually.</p>

<p>Edit mode</p>
<p>The first thing that grabs attention when you see the homepage is the slider. The slider is actually one of our widgets, and you can easily modify it by clicking on the edit icon, or you can simply delete it by pressing the trashcan icon. Each of the widgets have their own options depending on the features they present and context.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you hover over a widget you will see the handlers that let you modify the size of your widget.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vizibility</p>
<p>You can choose on wich pages to showcase a custom zone by playing around with vizibility options.</p>

<p>Post types / Creating custom posts</p>
